Backend Test

created a web API which gives the response as per the requirement :

Please find the below endpoints :

https://localhost:44386/api/campaign/AllCampaigns
https://localhost:44386/api/campaign/ActiveCampaigns
https://localhost:44386/api/campaign/ClosedCampaigns


Frontend Test

Created a webpage showing 3 products as per requirement. 
On changing currency it is calling the mentioned URL and calculating the value using the exchange rate in the response.
Note : Since page is not re-rendering first time, values are showing exactly opposite. However values are proper.
1 USD = 75 Rupee as per exchange rate getting from the mentioned Url.
I couldn't fix this known issue since I had to work on the issues(Office work) which are high priority. I can fix it if I get a day more.
